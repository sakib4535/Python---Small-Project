"""
Suppose we want to create a class to represent complex numbers and perform some mathematical operations on them.
Specifically, we want to implement a class ComplexNumber with the following methods:

1. __init__(self, real_part, imaginary_part): Constructor that initializes a new complex number with the given real
and imaginary parts.

2. add(self, other): Adds the current complex number to another complex number other and returns the result
as a new ComplexNumber object.

3. multiply(self, other): Multiplies the current complex number by another complex number other
and returns the result as a new ComplexNumber object.

4. conjugate(self): Computes the conjugate of the current complex number and returns it as a new ComplexNumber object.
